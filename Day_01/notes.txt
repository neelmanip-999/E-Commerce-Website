MVC Architecture (Modal View Controller)

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.

It's a software design pattern used for developing user interfaces.

The goal is to separate concerns: business logic, UI, and input control.

Model handles data and business logic.

View is responsible for the UI or output.

Controller handles user input and interactions.

Model notifies the View when data changes.

View renders data received from the Model.

Controller updates the Model based on user actions.

This separation improves code maintainability and scalability.

Example: In a web app, Model = database logic.

View = HTML/CSS UI presented to users.

Controller = handles HTTP requests and calls Model/View.

MVC is commonly used in frameworks like Spring (Java), Django (Python), and ASP.NET.

It allows teams to work on Model, View, and Controller independently.
